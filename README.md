# URLCleanr

Automatically bypasses tracking and redirect links—takes you straight to the real URL.

## What is it?
URLCleanr is a Chrome extension that detects when you click on a link wrapped in tracking or redirect URLs (like DoubleClick, Google, or job boards) and automatically sends you to the real destination, skipping all the click-junk.

## Features
- Instantly redirects you from click-tracking links to the real target URL
- Works on all sites, no setup required
- Simple and lightweight

## How to install
1. Download or clone this repo.
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/` in Chrome.
3. Enable "Developer mode".
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select this folder.
5. Done!

## Why?
Because clicking a link should take you straight to where you want to go, not through someone else’s analytics.
